# Doggo_2.0
Creative_Coding1 Final project
Doggo_2.0 is an interactive game that involves a small dog character evading objects, including plants and birds, by ducking and jumping over these objects.

When I began this project, I first thought of different games I played as a kid, like Tetris or the google dinosaur game, and how I interacted with them. After this, I began to illustrate my characters using photoshop and how they would interact with the main character once they met. After thinking about this process, I began to code the ground and the ground level while also thinking about how to make it never-ending. After developing this code for the never-ending background, I then applied this code to each aspect of the game, including the different plant characters and the random order of how each character, including the flying bird character. After this, I would then add the restart option once the dog character intersects with one of the plants or bird obstacles. The last major part of the code was adding the timer and score, which would record your time and score as you progressed in the game. And the last part was creating a fun and bright-looking background that matched the characters' aesthetic.

Some techniques I used throughout this code were a combination of image orientation, user interactivity, animated geometry, looping code for the ground and the looping audio that played in the background as you played the game, object orientation for each character and as well as the ground and the randomized code for the random time, the height that each object appeared in and there spacing, importing audio and importing my png art for my characters and my art for the background.

Through this piece of code, I constantly struggled with the portion of the code which included adding sound in at the exact moment that the user hits the specific key, which was "R" to restart, the spacebar to jump, and the "S" to allow the character to duck.

The overall jumping and audio additions to the game were a great success. Regarding any weaknesses I think that I struggled with, the ducking action has the occasional problem with the overall movement and the timing of the audio addition, but overall, I feel that the game is a great
